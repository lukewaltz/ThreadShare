# ThreadShare
CSC-484 Final Project - ThreadShare Ecommerce App MVP

## Project Overview  
Threadshare is an ecommerce app that allows users to buy, rent, and sell clothing items to/from members of their community.  
The key feature we chose to implement is the ability to browse products visit their individual product pages by clicking on them.  

## Set Up
1. Clone the repository into your local IDE with `git clone https://github.com/lukewaltz/ThreadShare.git`
2. cd into `/my-app` and run `npm install`
3. run on local host with `npm start`

## Functionality
1. Hardcoded Browse Page with 3 products  
2. Hardcoded Product Pages for each of the products
